            <p>I am a web developer looking to expand my experience in the profession. This page is a display about myself, as well as some of my current
                 abilities in the space. </p> 
            <p>I was born in Prince George then moved to Kelowna with my family when I was 10 years old, and have lived in Kelowna ever since. I graduated
                 from Okanagan College with a Bachelor of Computer Information Systems (BCIS) Degree. After achieving my degree, I believed that I wanted 
                 to be a system administrator. This was because I liked the idea of making sure that I could give people the functionality of systems when
                 they needed it and that everything ran correctly. However, I also became very interested in web development, considering that the internet
                 is becoming â€“or for the most part has already become, a very central part of all computer systems. The idea of applying what I already
                 know and learning more about web development with Acro Media has become a very exciting prospect for me. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I love to learn, and want to continue to learn all of my life. The internet and web development are both fascinating topics to learn about,
                 as well as being a good source to learn from. My degree from Okanagan College as well as some previous work experience has given me all of
                 the base education and skills to be a great asset to your team and help me continue down my web development career path.
