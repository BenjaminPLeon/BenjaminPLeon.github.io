            <p>I am a web developer looking to enter the profession.  This page is a display of some of my current abilities in the space.</p> 
            <p>I was born in Prince George and moved to kelowna with my family when I was 10 and have lived in kelowna ever since.  I graduated form Okanagan College
                with a BCIS (Bachelor of Computer Information Systems) Degree.  After this I believed that I wanted to be a system administrator, as I liked making
                sure that everything ran correctly and that I could give people the functionality of systems when they needed it.  However I also became very interested
                in web development, considering that the internet is becoming (or for the most part has already become) a very central part of all computer systems, and
                the idea of learning to develop web sites and web pages has become more and more a very exciting prospect to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love to learn, and want to continue to learn all of my life.  The internet and web development are both a great topic to learn about, aswell as a good
                source to learn from.  My degree from Okanagan College has also given me all of the base education that I will need to continue down my web development
                path.
